# Arkanoid-Game-Cpp

This is my second C++ game project, based on the famous brick breaker game Arkanoid

The game has the following features:
- Custom physics regarding the ball-brick collision
- Ability to change the ball's direction by moving the paddle correctly: If you are moving the paddle at the moment of the collision with the ball, you can transfer some of your momentum into the ball, allowing for a more precise level of control
- Three different powerups:
    - Triple Ball: Your ball splits into three different balls, triple destruction!
    - Barrier: You gain a proctective barrier that doesn't allow the ball to be lost, but it can only sustain a given amount of hits
    - Cannons: Take the destroying action on your hands and use SPACEBAR to fire powerful dual cannons into the bricks!
- Ability to precisely aim the starting shot: Simply point your mouse cursor where you want to throw the ball and press SPACEBAR to start the round

Achieve victory by destroying all the bricks!
